Development Process & My Role

I adopted a modern workflow for this project, leveraging AI tools for initial brainstorming and then taking full control to build out the high-value,interactive features.

AI-Assisted Prototyping: I used AI to generate a foundational layout and a professional dark-themed color palette. This allowed me to quickly move past the boilerplate and focus on the features that matter.

Manual Feature Development & Refinement: My primary role was to bring the static design to life and ensure its quality. I personally wrote the JavaScript from scratch for:

The light/dark mode theme switcher, including the logic to save the user's preference.

The animated counters, which detect when the user scrolls to the section and initiate the animation.

Custom Styling and UX: I designed and implemented the custom CSS for the interactive hover effects on the program cards and ensured all navigation was intuitive. I refactored the AI-generated code to use semantic HTML and organized the stylesheets for better maintainability.
